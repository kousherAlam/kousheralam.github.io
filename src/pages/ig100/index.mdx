## Introduction to iG100

It connects any analogue or digital sensors, relay outputs, PWM outputs and
connect other sensors by using CAN BUS or MODBUS protocol using high speed
Serial and CAN BUS adapter. The gateways can connect 16 sensors using direct
connection and maximum 128 using extenders.

Cost effective iG100 product connects 4 analogue and 12 digital sensors with 4 PWM output and 4 relay output. It provides on board CAN BUS and MODBUS protocol support with Ethernet and Wi-Fi capability. The system is loaded with on-chip MQTT server which can stream data to the cloud such as AWS (Amazon Web Service) or you can host your own IoT event processing and decision support system. CAN Bus port enables the device to interface directly with any vehicle and can transmit sensor information by using 3G/ LTE connection.

It has build in web control panel and background if-then-else controller.
