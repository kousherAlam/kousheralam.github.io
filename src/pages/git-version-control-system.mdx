## What is Verson Control System - VCS

VCS or Version control system is the backbone of any modern software development. It not only track changes on the code also allow thousand upon thousand developer work on same project concurrently.

VCS allow to manage the version and changes of the file. In software develpment which is the most important things. It also allow us implement different task depend on different situation of code.

CI/CD one of most popular things now days, VCS allow us to implment this kind
of system system.

## What is git ?

Git is a version control software, it is a open source, modern, disributed and
most popular version control system. git is very easy to use and support in
almost every code hosted server. as git is a distributed system so it keep
copy of same file in developer computer, thus it allow to work with out
connected with internet. there are a saying about git.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer.

git is hard to learn, but easy to use.

### What is the differennce between git and other vcs system ?

    Git is Distributed
    Git is Faster for trcking code / text based file.
    Git is not that fast for tracking binary file or video or audio.

## State of a file in git

- Commited: Data in this file in local git database.
- Modified: This file has updated content from git last recorded state.
- Saged: reday for commit after modified
- Untrack File: File is not in git database yet. git will not track it's
  anything untill we explicitly tell git so.

## Three state of a git project

Working Directory
Single copy of one version of the project
Staging Area (index)
Area between working directory and .git repository. It allow user to
commit multiple file and only track one file.
.git Directory (Repository)
In here git store meta data and object database for project
If any file here, it is commited and sotred in git database

## Git Documantation From CLI

we can get any help from git cli by typing this command `git help <commang-name>`.
Configuring git

    Git allow us to configure the enviory for global, user and project scope. By
    configuring git we provide our details and basic info. By

    git config command
    we configure git.

## Start a new repository and some basic commnad

- clone Clone a repository into a new directory
- init Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
- fetch Download objects and refs from another repository
- pull Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
- push Update remote refs along with associated objects
- add
- commit

## Tracking files via git

## Working on the current change

`--allow-empty` flag is use to commit with no change.
`git commit -a -m

### Git commit guideline

- add Add file contents to the index
- mv Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
- restore Restore working tree files
- rm Remove files from the working tree and from the index
- sparse-checkout Initialize and modify the sparse-checkout

## History, Status And travel through time in git

git status --short

- bisect Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
- diff Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
- grep Print lines matching a pattern
- log Show commit logs
- show Show various types of objects
- status Show the working tree status

## How git track changes when we rename or move a file.

## Git Diff

git diff --staged

## Git Reset

Allow us to changes commited.
git reset --soft : commit back to stagin area
git reset --mixed - move change back to working directory
git reset --hard move changes to trash

## Remove file from git

`git rm  <file_name>` --cached

## Git Branch and more tools

branch List, create, or delete branches
commit Record changes to the repository
merge Join two /p>or more development histories together
merge Join two or more development histories together
merge Join two or more development histories together
rebase Reapply commits on top of another base tip
reset Reset current HEAD to the specified state
switch Switch branches
tag Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

A branch in git is a lightweight moveable pointer. It allow us to do make and maintain concurrent change on on project. which is very, very helpful. Suppose we are working on a project and after sometime we want to test some of our code and feature, so in git we can create a branch for that and make or changes and maintain it on that brach without effecting others code.

`git checkout -b <branch-name>`

- to rename a branch use `git branch -m <oldBranchName> <newName>`
- to delete a branch use `git branch -d <branch-name>` to force the command use `-D` command.

## Comparing and merging brances

- git merge branchToMarge

### Fast Forward Merge

target and source
target: Refers to the branch that we want to modify by merging changes in
sources: Refers to the branch that has the changes we want.
Whe we merge only the target branch changes. source is not changes while merge.s

- first we need to switch to the target branch by running `git chekcout <target-branch> `
- then merge the change with `git merge <source-branch>` command.

git diff can be use to compare branches

git diff branch1 branch2 to see the changes between the two brances, it is a report only task. do not change anything on the file systems.

## Git rebase - pick, squase, rebase

it use to clean the branches, it increase accuracy and clearity.

- clean up local history before sharing
- pull changes form another branch without performing merge.s

- do not use rebase on a public branch.
- do not use rebase anywhere , shome of the
- do not use rebase
