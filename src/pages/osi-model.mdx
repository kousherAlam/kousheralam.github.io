## OSI Model

### The Problem OSI Model Solve

Layers of OSI Model
In OSI model every layer is some package of protocol.

### Layer 1: Physical Layer:

Received Sinal and Convert it to frame for the Data Link Layer.

### Layer 2: Data Link Layer:

Data link layer embaded in computer network interface card. It perform two basic operation it access media using framing
Logical Address
Physical Address : mac address assigned.
CSMA: Career Sense Multiple Access.

### Layer 3: Network Layer:

Send DAta from one computer and other computer. Ip addressing is done here. It's assign sender and receiver an ip address. Routing is done here.

### Layer 4: Transport Layer:

It controls relaibility of data transform. port, secuence,
Flow
Automatic Repeat Request
TCP, UDP
TCP Does give Feedback While UDP does not give any feedback.

### Layer 5: Session Layer:

It helps setting up and keep the connection with network. It keep track which data packet belong to which file in a perticular connection. it help with Sessing management, authentication, and in authorization.

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer:

It received data from application layer. It's convert appliation data into binary format. In here computer uses data compression such as gzip. Before that data is encrypted. Translation / Compression / Encryption / Decription

### Layer 7: Application Layer:

Is used by network application, means computer application which use Network. Expample: google chrome. There are many protocol involve here, such as http, https, ftp, smtp, telnet etc..
