## Protocol Buffer:

---

Initially Release in 2008 by google. It use binary format instate of text based format so very compress and small in message size thus increasing in speed.

Protocol buffer is platform and language neutral and support version massages, so we can improve our existing api without hurting other application which are using old api.

Protocol buffer separate context of the message from the data of the message.

```javascript
{
	firstname: "kousher",
	lastname: "alam"
}
```

combined context with data, but in protocol buffer

we define a context such

```
message Person {
	string firstname = 1;
	string lastname = 2;
}
```

in this we define our context with an indentifier, with this we send the data like this
126Kousher227alam

the way it is encoding
`<field_number> + <field_type> + <data>`  
in the 126kousher message

1 = map to filed = firstname
2 = defined that it is lenght based value
6 = lenght of the data
kousher = data
