## Technical Overview

This software consists of multiple layers of software and system integrated as one single unit to provide high quality of user experience.

- Facial recognition machine learning layer
- Web Dashboard interface for management
- API for 3rd party integration


### Technology

- Camera and Integrated computer
- Nodejs and Angular for web dashboard
- Postgresql as database layer
- Python for machine learning layer
- Docker and managed server for hosting
- WebSocket for real time alert
